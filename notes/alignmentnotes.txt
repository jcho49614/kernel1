Alignment --> address is a multiple of N.

eg: 0x1000 is aligned to 16
0x1003 is NOT aligned to 4.

Alignment is crucial because:
- CPUs cannot load misaligned data
- If they can, they become slower and often won't work
- CPUs fetch memory in 64 byte blocks, so if data crosses these boundaries I get additional load instructions
- ABI (Application Binary Interface) rules exist (every platform has alignment rules) to call functions consistently and work stable.

ALIGNMENT at 4 levels:
1. CPU hardware alignment
- Loads, stores, SIMD, Cache lines
2. Compiler alignment
- Struct layout, variable alignment, stack alignment
3. Linker alignment
- .text .data .bss, page alignment
4., Filesystem/bootloader alignment
- OS image must be aligned to sector boundaries
